Our Story

It all started with a group of international friends who loved bringing people together. We spent years organizing events, building connections, and learning what makes a party truly memorable. But eventually, the sheer hassle of managing it all began to overshadow the fun, and we stepped back.

In our own private events, a new problem emerged. Photos and videos were constantly getting lost, scattered across dozens of camera rolls. The real magic happened months or years later when we'd reunite. Someone would uncover a photo buried in their gallery—a perfect shot of you from their perspective. That feeling of rediscovering a lost moment was pure joy.

That spark was the foundation for PXI. We first set out to solve that one problem: creating a shared album so no memory would be lost again. That single idea evolved into PXIStudio, our all-in-one platform designed to eliminate the friction we knew so well and elevate the entire social experience.

As we tirelessly perfected the digital side, we wanted to bridge it with the physical world. We looked for a way to turn our phones into instant cameras, to hold a memory in our hands the moment it was made. That's why we created the PXIClip—to make the process truly seamless, from a flash on a screen to a photo in your pocket.
